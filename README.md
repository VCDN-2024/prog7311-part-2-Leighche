## 🟢 Introduction

In response to the growing need for sustainable agricultural practices and the integration of green energy solutions in South Africa, the visionary initiative named "Agri-Energy Connect" has been conceptualized. This initiative aims to develop an innovative web platform that connects the agricultural sector with green energy technology providers. Key features of the platform include a Green Energy Marketplace and a platform for farmers to sell their products.

### Green Energy Marketplace

- A marketplace for green energy solutions tailored to agricultural needs, such as solar-powered irrigation systems, wind turbines for farms, and biogas energy solutions.

### Farmer Product Selling Platform

- A platform where farmers can sell their products.

## 🟠 Functionality Requirements

1. **Database Development and Integration:**
   - Design and integrate a relational database to manage information about farmers and their products.
   - Populate the database with sample data to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring the demonstration is robust and comprehensive.

2. **User Role Definition and Authentication System:**
   - Two user roles within the system:
     - Farmer: Can add products to their profile and view their own product listings.
     - Employee: Can add new farmer profiles, view all products from specific farmers, and use filters for product searching.
   - There is a secure login functionality with authentication mechanisms to protect user data and ensure role-specific access.

3. **Functional Features for Farmers and Employees:**
   - For Farmers:
     - Product addition feature where farmers can add new products with details like name, category, and production date.
   - For Employees:
     - Ability to add new farmer profiles with essential details.
     - Capability to view and filter a comprehensive list of products from any farmer based on criteria such as date range and product type.

## 🟢 Setup Instructions
