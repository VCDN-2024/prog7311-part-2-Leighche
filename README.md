## Introduction

In response to the growing need for sustainable agricultural practices and the integration of green energy solutions in South Africa, the visionary initiative named "Agri-Energy Connect" has been conceptualized. This initiative aims to develop an innovative web platform that connects the agricultural sector with green energy technology providers. Key features of the platform include a Green Energy Marketplace and a platform for farmers to sell their products.

### Green Energy Marketplace

- A marketplace for green energy solutions tailored to agricultural needs, such as solar-powered irrigation systems, wind turbines for farms, and biogas energy solutions.

### Farmer Product Selling Platform

- A platform where farmers can sell their products.

## Functionality Requirements

   - Implement secure login functionality with authentication mechanisms to protect user data and ensure role-specific access.

3. **Functional Features for Farmers and Employees:**
   - For Farmers:
     - Enable product addition feature where farmers can add new products with details like name, category, and production date.
