## Introduction

In response to the growing need for sustainable agricultural practices and the integration of green energy solutions in South Africa, the visionary initiative named "Agri-Energy Connect" has been conceptualized. This initiative aims to develop an innovative web platform that connects the agricultural sector with green energy technology providers. Key features of the platform include a Green Energy Marketplace and a platform for farmers to sell their products.

### Green Energy Marketplace

- A marketplace for green energy solutions tailored to agricultural needs, such as solar-powered irrigation systems, wind turbines for farms, and biogas energy solutions.

### Farmer Product Selling Platform

- A platform where farmers can sell their products.

## Functionality Requirements

1. **Database Development and Integration:**
   - Design and integrate a relational database to manage information about farmers and their products.
   - Populate the database with sample data to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring the demonstration is robust and comprehensive.

2. **User Role Definition and Authentication System:**
   - Develop two distinct user roles within the system:
     - Farmer: Can add products to their profile and view their own product listings.
     - Employee: Can add new farmer profiles, view all products from specific farmers, and use filters for product searching.
   - Implement secure login functionality with authentication mechanisms to protect user data and ensure role-specific access.

3. **Functional Features for Farmers and Employees:**
   - For Farmers:
     - Enable product addition feature where farmers can add new products with details like name, category, and production date.
   - For Employees:
     - Functionality to add new farmer profiles with essential details.
     - Capability to view and filter a comprehensive list of products from any farmer based on criteria such as date range and product type.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up the development environment:

1. **Tools Required:**
   - Visual Studio (preferably the latest version)
   - .NET Framework
   - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore

2. **Downloading the App:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Open the project in Visual Studio.
   - Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including .NET Framework and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore packages.

## Installation and Setup

Once you have cloned the repository and ensured all dependencies are installed, follow these steps to install and set up the application:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command to restore any missing dependencies:
3. Configure the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file.
4. Run the following command to apply any database migrations://///////////////////////////////////////////////////
5. Once the database is set up, you can now build and run the application.

## Building and Running the Prototype

To build and run the prototype, follow these steps:

1. Build the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Run the application from Visual Studio or deploy it to a web server.

## System Functionalities and User Roles

- **Farmers:**
- Add new products to their profile.
- View their own product listings.
- **Employees:**
- Add new farmer profiles with essential details.
- View and filter a comprehensive list of products from any farmer based on criteria such as date range and product type.

## ðŸ”µ Roadmap

Here's our roadmap for Agri-Energy Connect, with an overview of completed tasks and planned features.
